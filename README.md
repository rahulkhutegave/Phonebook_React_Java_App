# Phonebook_React_Java_App

This app only does standard CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) operations.

Simply make a clone of the git repository. Open the code in a Java-compatible IDE. <br>
run the "mvn clean package" command after that.<br>
This will download all of the Java and React dependencies.<br>
It will automatically build the React and Java code. This could take close to 15 minutes the first time.

Run the Spring Boot program after that. afterwards open the browser and type "http://localhost:8080/"<br>
Now you can use the application.
